## Questions
Update this README file by answering the questions below:

### Date Or Reflection
10/21/2021

### Time spent
Around 3 hours. Could've been shorter but I didn't know what a csv file was so I had to spend some time learning it.

### Assumptions made
There is a vendor name called LONDON DRUGS with a trailing space afterwards. I'm going to assume that this is a mistake and that trailing spaces do not make the values different.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made
I ignored the rows where either category or subcategory wasn't provided. I'll assume if you want to properly get all the rows, you'll run sort_csv.py first.

### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about? Were you short on time and not able to include something that you want us to know about? Please list it here so that we know that you considered it.

### Other information about your submission that you feel is important that we know

## Feedback
Fun little assignment. Really allows me to show my skills in learning new things to solve a problem. In this case it was figuring out what a csv file is.
Would be great if the link to the interview process in indeed actually worked. I was kind of caught off guard by this assignment.
